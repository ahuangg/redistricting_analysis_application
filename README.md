# Redistricting Analaysis Application

### Prerequisite
* Typescript
* React
* Python
* MongoDB
* HPC Server

### Goal

* Evaluate effectiveness of distance measures for pairs of district plans
* Analyze clustering effects among ensemble of random district plans
* Understand patterns or clusters within an ensemble 
* Determine how many plans in an ensemble are needed to identify almost all clusters
* Visualize clusters
* Visualize of thousands of random plans for selection of individual plans

### Project Requirements
* Generate 10,000 random district plans for each of 3 states
* Measure pairwise distance between plans using various distance measures
* For each distance measure, perform cluster analysis to identify plan clusters
* Store data in a server database 
* Develop web interface to allow a user to

    * Visualize characteristics of all plans in an ensemble 
    * Determine best cluster distance
    * Visualize a cluster of plans
    * Visualize characteristics of the set of clusters
    * Select a plan form the ensemble based on quality measures of each plan
    * Compare the effectiveness of distance measures
