## RDH Date Retrieval
04/15/2022

## Sources
The RDH retrieved the VEST 2020 general precinct boundary and election results shapefile from [VEST's Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?fileId=5595329&version=35.0).
The RDH retrieved raw 2020 general election results from Election results from county reports via [OpenElections](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-pa).

## Notes on Field Names (adapted from VEST):
Columns reporting votes generally follow the pattern: 
The first character is G for a general election, P for a primary, S for a special, and R for a runoff.
Characters 2 and 3 are the year of the election.
Characters 4-6 represent the office type (see list below).
Character 7 represents the party of the candidate.
Characters 8-10 are the first three letters of the candidate's last name.
One example is:
G16PREDCLI
To fit within the GIS 10 character limit for field names, the naming convention is slightly different for the State Legislature and 
US House of Representatives. All fields are listed below with definitions.

PRE - President

## Processing Steps
    
The RDH joined additional election results to VEST's existing precinct shapefile, including U.S. President, Attorney General, Auditor General, State Treasurer, U.S. House, State Senate, State House using Python.
For more information on the processing completed, visit our [Github repository](https://github.com/nonpartisan-redistricting-datahub/erj-pa) for Election Result Joins (ERJ) for Pennsylvania.
Where possible, the RDH validated the election results we processed against VEST's election results. For additional races the RDH manually checked state totals. For more information on this comparison, please see our processing on Github (https://github.com/nonpartisan-redistricting-datahub/erj-pa).

## Additional Notes

VEST uses a different election results source for Susquehanna, Crawford, Forest and Franklin counties. See the VEST PA '20 PDV report (https://redistrictingdatahub.org/dataset/vest-2020-pennsylvania-precinct-and-election-results/) for more details. We were unable to locate these files and for the statewide races use the results generated with the OpenElections sources. 

Due to the manually intensive nature of OpenElection's work, there may be typos in their results. Due to the time-intensive nature of checking each transcription individually, which we did not attempt, the election totals in this file are checked at the statewide and county level against totals available from the Pennsylvania SOS election results website (https://www.electionreturns.pa.gov/). These results do not contain write-in totals nor the totals for Howie Hawkins. More information can be found in the Jupyter Notebook used to construct this file. VEST notes in their documentation for their precinct and election results file that, "Due to court orders involving ballots that were segregated until legal challenges were resolved the certified results from nearly all counties differ from the official results certified by the state. State courts ordered segregated ballots to be included for state offices whereas federal courts ordered that they be excluded for federal offices. As the orders were issued after the county certification deadline these votes were added to the state offices for 57 counties that did not include them in precinct reports and removed from federal offices in 10 counties that did include them in precinct reports. The precinct results in the VEST shapefiles are those that were certified by the respective counties." As a result, it is difficult to tell when election results differences are caused by this issue, which is basically unresolvable and typos in the election results. While we did investigate particularly large differences, and these are mentioned below, we cannot guarantee that the file is perfectly free of typos.

***pa_gen_20_st_sldu_prec.shp***
